## OrbChain


## Overview  
**OrbChain** is a python library to model mechanistic chemial reactions.  

### Key Features  
- It models a mechanistic reaction (i.e., a reaction with a single transition state) as the interaction of two Molecular Orbitals (MOs). 
- Given a mechanistic reaction as reactants>>products arrows , it finds the interacting MOs
- Given two interacting MOs in a set of reactant molecules, it will generate the products and arrows of that reaction.
